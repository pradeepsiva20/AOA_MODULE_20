# EX 2B BACKTRACKING - NQUEEN PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking, which places N queens on an N*N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.


## Algorithm
1. Start with an empty NÃ—N chessboard. Initialize the board with all zeroes.
2. Place a queen in the leftmost column of the first row, then recursively attempt to place queens in the next columns.
3. Before placing a queen in a cell, check if it's safe by ensuring there are no other queens in the same row, upper-left diagonal, or lower-left diagonal. 
4. If placing a queen leads to a valid solution, move to the next column. If it leads to a dead-end, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next row in the 
   current column.
5. Continue this process until all queens are placed or all possibilities are exhausted. If all queens are placed, print the board.
